### Learnings from the project

 **Appending, Slicing, Filtering, Aggregating** _NumPy arrays,_


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 **First We often associate the potential of a country based on the age distribution of the people residing there. I did a simple analysis of the age distribution and described the country as a young country.**
**Next The constitution of the country tries it's best to ensure that people of all races are able to live harmoniously. So I identified  the country's  minorities race by counting number of races and their count respectively so that the government can help them.**
**Next  by comparing the education num with job average pay it is concluded that  better education leads to better job pay.**
